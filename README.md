~Organization~
1. Folder Structure
2. Naming

* FOLDER STRUCTURE *
The folder structure should closely resemble the final RUBY organizational structure.
All resources should be kept within the ASSETS folder given the following information
1. All images will be kept in ASSETS/IMAGES
2. All javascript files will be kept in ASSETS/JAVASCRIPTS
3. All stylesheets will be kept in ASSETS/STYLESHEETS

* Naming *
The naming convention for files should be kept consistent with Ruby standards
(https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-directory-structure.htm)

For controller specific actions we will use the following naming
CONTROLLER.action.html which translate as such
1. CONTROLLER becomes a folder
2. All files with CONTROLLER prefix are moved into folder
3. The CONTROLLER prefix is removed
4. The erb extension is added
